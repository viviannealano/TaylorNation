            <p>
                This simple blog website is our Pre Final examination in ITMC 222 Advance Database Systems. In this blog I learned how to incorporate Node.JS in
                a blog site in which I started from scratch with the help of the lecture videos from node ninja and slowly I built a server and with the help of 
                third-party packages such as express, morgan and mongoose and our database in which I utilize mongodb atlas, I was able to create a simple blog
                site that can read, write and delete blogs entries by the user. As I progress to the videos I learned the importance of learning the basic of programming
                especially learning the beginner level in which one codes rigorously with very long codes and complex functions (just like in the videos) and
                appreciating it when one moves to a higher level in which the coding part is simplified and efficiently reduced to short codes. Personally, I believe
                doing this process is a fundamental and beneficial experience as starting in this field is really a challenge but beginners must be ambitious to believe
                that it'll get easier as he/she continues on the journey.
